# APWorld Index

Primarily designed for my [APWorld Manager](https://github.com/silasary/Archipelago/releases?q=Manager), this repo tries to be a comprehensive list of every apworld that exists.

I make no promises about compatibility, quality, or trustworthiness.  I just index everything that can be indexed.

Where possible, I'll try to tag worlds as AD/Not in Main Server, but I do not know most of the games listed, and oversights have almost certainly occurred.

## Adding a world

You have two options:
* Add a link to the github repo to a file named `queue.txt`, then use `scripts/add_worlds.py` to automatically scrape every release in that repo.
* Manually create a yaml file in the index folder with the Game name and repo, and let the nightly script do the rest.

## I want to add a game, but the creator only posts APWorlds on Discord

Ask them to post releases on a github.  I can't do anything if it's not queryable by an API.
